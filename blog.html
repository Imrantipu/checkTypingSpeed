        <h1>Q1:Difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the clientâ€™s computer in the form of key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is cleared.
</p>
<p>It's data in the browser can only be accessed via JavaScript and HTML5. However, the user also could clear the browser data/cache to erase all local storage data. It has four methods that we can use to set, retrieve, remove and clear:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can use the setItem() method to set the data in local storage. This method takes two parameters, i.e., key and value. With this method, we can store value with a key. localStorage.setItem(key, value);</li>
    <li>The data stored in it has no expiration date</li>
    <li>The storage limit is about 10MB</li>
    <li>Its data is never transferred to the server</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session Storage</h2>
<p>It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can also set and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the local storage methods.</p>
